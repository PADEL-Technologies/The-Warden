# warden

Discord bot.

## Run

```bash
uv sync
DISCORD_TOKEN=... uv run main.py
```

Or via `make install` / `DISCORD_TOKEN=... make run` (same commands, see `Makefile`).

## Adding a feature

One feature = one folder under `warden/features/`, laid out like `ping/`:

```
warden/features/greet/
    __init__.py                     wiring: setup(bot) builds the deps and adds the cog
    handlers/greet_handler.py       the Cog — Discord in, Discord out
    services/protocol.py            what the handler depends on
    services/greet_service.py       the implementation
```

The folder is discovered and loaded automatically — there is no registry to
edit, so two people adding features never conflict. The only requirement is
`setup(bot)` in the feature's `__init__.py`:

```python
# warden/features/greet/__init__.py
from discord.ext import commands

from warden.features.greet.handlers.greet_handler import GreetHandlers
from warden.features.greet.services.greet_service import GreetService


async def setup(bot: commands.Bot) -> None:  # required, or the folder never loads
    await bot.add_cog(GreetHandlers(bot, GreetService()))
```

Handlers take services as constructor arguments, typed against the protocol —
that keeps the service testable without booting a bot.

## Checks

```bash
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format . && uv run pytest
```

Or `make check`. Same three commands run in CI on every push and PR.

## Docker

```bash
make docker-build
make docker-run   # reads DISCORD_TOKEN from .env
```

Multi-stage build (`Dockerfile`): dependencies are installed in a `builder`
stage, the runtime stage copies only the built venv and `warden/`/`main.py`
— no `uv`, no build tools, no audio/voice libs in the final image. Runs
headless as a non-root user, timezone pinned to `Asia/Jakarta`.

## AI harness

This repo carries a graphify knowledge graph (`graphify-out/`) and Serena
project memories (`.serena/memories/`) for AI coding assistants. `.graphifyignore`
keeps the graph scoped to `warden/` source only — no docs/config noise.

- `make update-harness` — refresh the graph (code-only, no viz) and clear
  Serena's stale symbol cache. Safe to run anytime.
- `make install-hooks` — opt in to a pre-commit hook (`.github/hooks/pre-commit`)
  that does the same refresh automatically before each commit.
